# Awful Recruiters

I'm starting to compile a list of domains of recruiters. The goal is to get less email that I would never read anyway.

If your company's domain is on this list and you feel it is there by mistake, send me a pull request explaining why you feel it is a mistake and I will consider merging it.

## Running Locally

Simply run the following commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/soffes/awfulrecruiters.com
    $ cd awfulrecruiters.com
    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec foreman start

Then open <http://localhost:5000> in your favorite browser.

Enjoy.
